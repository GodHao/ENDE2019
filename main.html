    	The 24th International Workshop on Electromagnetic Nondestructive Evaluation (ENDE2019) will be held on September 11-14, 2019, at the Longemont Hotels in Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
   </p>
    <p>
    	This year's technical sessions, student posters competition, industry exhibition, tour, and other special events will be coordinated by University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Sichuan University and Southwest Jiaotong University. The subjects of the 24th workshop will focus on the theoretical and applied research on Electromagnetic Non-destructive Evaluation methods and provide a wonderful opportunity to exchange ideas and update on the latest developments.
