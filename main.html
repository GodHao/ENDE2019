	<p>
    	The 24rd International Workshop on Electromagnetic Nondestructive Evaluation (ENDE2019) will be held on September 11-14, 2019, at the Longemont Hotels Chengdu in Chengdu Sichuan , China.
    </p>
    <p>
    	This year's technical sessions, student posters competition, industry exhibition and tour, and other special events will be coordinated by the 
		 NDE Laboratory at SouthWest JiaoTong University. We hope to provide a comprehensive and well-balanced program in theoretical and applied research of electromagnetic NDE (eNDE) methods. This workshop is intended to provide an international forum for the exchange of information on state-of-the-art technologies and development in NDE sensors, modeling, signal processing, inverse problems, materials state awareness and characterization, damage diagnosis and prognosis, biomedical applications, Applications on Railway and innovative industrial applications of eNDE.</p>
    <p>
    	Through a range of technical and social activities, ENDE2019 will provide a unique opportunity to interact with the world's leading experts in electromagnetic NDE from academia, industry and government.
    </p>
    <p>
        We welcome you to join us for an exciting program in the land of plenty in 2019!
    </p>
